3/23 - 01: CSS

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
* Controls how HTML elements look
* Rule based language

Selector: selects html element that is going to be styled
Declarations: inside curly brackets - property and value pairs
curly - property - colon - value
Google: "mdn css-feature-name" to find different CSS features
Specs - docs housing specifications/definitions on how css behaves

Ways to insert CSS:

* External: insert link in html in brackets: link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css" - cannot contain html in doc, no space between property value and unit
* Internal: contained on single page between style element in head section of html page
* Inline: contained within attributes of single elements - p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph. /p * don't do this
* Last read style will be selected if multiple

Cascading order: rule when more than one style specified for html element
1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
