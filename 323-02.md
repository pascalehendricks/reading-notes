Variables: containers for storing data

Declare a JavaScript Variable - usually at begin of scipt:
1. Using var
2. Using let
3. Using const
4. Using nothing

Ex: let x = 2
undeclared: x = 3 - should always declare

"var" keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015, no longer liked or used
"let" and "const" keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015

Const - cannot change, used for non variable decs, cannot re-declare with this or let
Let - if the value of the variable can change

**Identifiers**: all variables must be ID'd with unique names aka these
Rules:

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter
* Names can also begin with $ and _
* Names are case sensitive
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

* Assignment operator - equal sign, doesn't mean equal to - this does: ==

* Data types: numbers and text strings -which are text values written in single or double quotes, numbers no quote unless text

* declare:
var treename
assign value:
treename= "mango";

* both:
var treename = "mango";
let treename = "mango", flowername = "lily"; price = 4000;

* Value = undefined - added after statement

* Arithmetic can be used using + and =, any number in quotes will have strings follow

* $ and _ treated as letters so it can be a variable name

* Things within curly braces are code blocks, are related in some way

* === means very equal

* boolean - true false statments
