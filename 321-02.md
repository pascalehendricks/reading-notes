There are endless amounts of text editors! This is what you use to build and create code on your computer. Each have subtle differences that are up to user preference, and all are able to help you write and develop code or just practice.

Different features include varying color themes, available extensions, and code completion.
Code completion automatically closes the brackets of the codes that you begin, greatly helping you keep organized and reduce the chances of bugs.
Your computer comes with a text editor built in, but this application won't allow you the features and ease that another will - they won't include any of the features listed above: varying color themes, available extensions, and code completion.
Eventually, you may use an IDE: Integrated Development Environment that integrates more features.


The **command line** is the same thing as the **terminal**, which is a database of your computer's files and information, where you're able to type commands and receive information (this is case sensitive). Within the terminal, you will find:

* Shell: " This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you". The most common is called "bash", and you can use the command "echo" to find which shell you're using.

#### Common Commands/keywords
