### Version Control: system that enables visits to various version of files and track changes

* Local = on your own computer
* Centralized = information is stored on a single server but accessed by many developers
* Distributed = mirrors repos in order to back up information, enables simultaneous workflows

Git: DVCS composed of snapshots/versions of a project that are stored safely

* Relies on local operations/local disk
* Tracks changes and possible file corruption
* Commit = save/stored in local database
* Modified = changed file not yet saved
* Staged = Changed version of file is flagged to be committed

## Using Git: [^1].

* To get more information or help on a command, type: git help command
* Import:
  * Make sure you're in the right directory - cd test
  * git init
  * git commit -m"insert note"
* Cloning: copying all version of all files for your project
  * git clone https://github.com/test : creates directory called 'test' with copies
* File status: git status
* Tracking & Staging new file:
  * git add filename - for one file
  * git add * - for all files
* Commit file: git commit -m"notes"
* Commit all changes: git commit -a
* Push changes: git push origin master
* Stashing: not ready to commit changes but want to save progress, temporarily changes and hides to provide clean directory
  * git stash : hides
  * git stash apply : retrieves

Repository:
1. Working directory - where the files live
2. Index - staging area
3. Head - points to the most recent commit

* Tracked: files/working copy of a project that can be modified, unmodified, or staged, part of the most recent snapshot/save
* Untracked: files that were not in the last snapshot and aren't living in the staging area

Process:
1. Edit/modify
2. Stage modified file
3. Commit staged changes
