## Reading Notes 3/22 - 02

Wireframe: a UX practice that defines information hierarchy for any given site, app, etc. -aka layout - with the user experience as a main priority in black and white. Essentially a rough draft sketch
Steps: research, preparing research to be seen, user flow mapping, draft & sketch, start building wireframe with simple details, and test, turn wireframe into prototype

HTML: code/markup language used to structure web pages and content
* elements: used to enclose, wrap different parts of content
* tags: within elements, authorize words, images, fonts to be bold, different sizes, italicized, hyperlinked, etc. need opening and closing tags
* attributes: extra information about the element not wanted in content, should always include space between it and element name or previous attribute, attribute name followed by =, and attribute value wrapped in quotation marks
* class = type of attribute that gives element targetting identifier
* Nesting: way to put elements inside other elements, need to open and close fully within element
*empty elements: have no content, no closing tag

Structure:
- <!DOCTYPE html> : required to give html rules to doc
- <html></html> root element
- <head></head> : container that includes things like keywords, CSS, declarations
- <meta charset="utf-8"> : enables most characters needed for text
- <title></title> : set title of page, what appears in browser/bookmark
- <body></body> : all content
- Anything between <! here > is a comment, browser will ignore, so you can put notes in there

Images:
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
- src = source, path for file
- alt = description, for when image isn't able to be seen or interpreted

<h1>My main title</h1>
There are 1-6, most common are 1-4

Paragraphs:
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>

Lists:

- Items inside list are denoted as <li> each

Links:
