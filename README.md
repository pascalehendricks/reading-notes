### **Growth Mindset**

To me, a growth mindset means approaching learning with humility, openness, and perseverance. It looks like being okay with not knowing but continuing forward nonetheless while using feedback as a valuable opportunity for strides forward. It also looks like being comfortable with being uncomfortable and knowing you don't have all of the answers, but that you can and will figure them out with time and energy. [^1].

**Examples**:

* Not being afraid to try new solutions on your own, but also not being afraid to ask for help if stuck

* Embracing all feedback as helpful

* Trying even if feeling like you'll fail
