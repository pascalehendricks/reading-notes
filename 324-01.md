3/24 - 01 Reading Notes

Control Flow - the order in which the computer executes script statments, conditions and loops can change control flow from default of beginning to end
if .., else prompts based on contingencies

function: code designed to perform a task, needs to be invoked. function name parenthesis with parameters curly brackets with code to be executed

* reusable with different arguments
* can be used same as variables in formulas and calculations - if declared within function, become local just to function
* function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
* parenthesis can include parameter names separated by commas
* arguments are values received by function when invoked


arguments - giving a function information
paramaters - info a function gets

Return statement - point at which function will stop executing

* if invoked from statement, JS will return to execute code after invoking statement
* return value given back if applicable

* parenthesis operator invokes function - accessing function without them will return function object instead of the result

Operators:
 = assigns value to a variable
plus sign adds numbers
plus sign adds strings together
star sign multiplies numbers
dash performs subtraction
slash is division
plusplus increment
dashdash decrement
starstar exponentiation
plusequal adds valua to a variable

Refactoring: change implementation by keeping same exact functionality
